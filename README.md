## Credit Portfolio Risk Analysis (EDA)

This project analyzes a large consumer loan portfolio (Lending Club–style data)
to assess credit risk using standard banking metrics such as:

- Days Past Due (DPD)
- Portfolio at Risk (PAR 30 / 60 / 90)
- Exposure concentration by loan term

### Key Focus
- Cleaned and standardized raw loan attributes
- Derived loan lifecycle and delinquency flags
- Computed exposure-weighted PAR metrics
- Compared risk profiles across 36 vs 60 month loans

### Notes
- Raw dataset (~1GB CSV) not included due to GitHub size limits
- Notebook is fully reproducible given the publicly available Lending Club dataset
